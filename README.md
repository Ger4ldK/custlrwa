The plan for this is a REST API done in Django REST Framework(DRF), as Python is the best option for web scraping right now - DRF is also done in Python, so this makes implementation easier. 

The server is going to be hosted on a uni-provided URL, and HTTP requests will be made by the frontend to get a JSON file for information.

# Description of project
The basic idea is to create something similar to Booking.com, where a web/mobile app will search other websites for tailored clothes specific to the user's specification. Users should ble able to find a listing of companies/shops which cater to their specific request.
